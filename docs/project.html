<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div id="a-visual-look-at-the-basic-allowance-for-housing-bah-in-the-national-capital-region" class="section level3">
<h3>A Visual Look at the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) in the National Capital Region</h3>
<p>Authorized under Section 37 of the United States Code, Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is an entitlement provided to service members when adequate housing is not provided or is otherwise unavailable at the individual’s current duty station. This compensation, set annually by the Secretary of Defense, is meant to cover 95 percent of the service member’s housing costs once adjusted for the individual’s location of assignment, pay grade (rank), and dependency status. That means that a service member assigned to a duty station near a major metropolitian area can expect to receive more compensation compared to a peer assigned to a more rural area since housing is typically more expensive near cities. Similarly, a more senior service member (by rank, not time in service) would receive a larger monthly payment in an attempt to align this compensation with what a civilain peer would typically pay for housing in the same market. To clarify, see the examples below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location Difference</strong>. A service member in the O-3 pay grade (that of an Army, Air Force, or Marine Captain) with dependents (spouse and/or children) could expect to receive the following monthly allowance at each location:
<ul>
<li>Washington, D.C.: $2,859<br />
</li>
<li>New York, NY: $4,281</li>
<li>Fort Riley, KS: $1,470</li>
<li>Colorado Springs, CO: $1,974</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pay Grade Difference</strong>. A service member assigned to the National Capital Region (Washington, D.C. and the surrounding area) could expect the following allowance based on their current rank:
<ul>
<li>E-3 (Army Private First Class): $2,328<br />
</li>
<li>E-8 (Army Master Sergeant): $2,787</li>
<li>O-3 (Army Captain): $2,859</li>
<li>O-6 (Army Colonel): $3,171</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>While every duty station has its own, unique challenges, assignments to the National Capital Region are particularly harsh for many service members who are often unfamiliar and unprepared to live in the nation’s sixth largest metropolitan area (Census Bureau). While the seat of the United States government since 1800, and hence a historically common area for service members to be assigned, the area has seen a recent surge in private-sector development exemplified by Amazon’s selection of Crystal City, Virginia as the location for its new HQ2 facility. This move has dramatically increased the demand housing, resulting in low inventory and high costs. Further compounding the issue of appropriate compensation is that the entire national capital region is managed as a single Military Housing Area, meaning that a service member assigned to Capital Hill will receive the same compensation as a service member assigned to Walter Reed National Medical Center (in Bethesda, Maryland) or Fort Belvoir (near Lorton, Virginia) despite vastly different housing costs near each location. Consequently, this visual story will examine the efficacy and fairness of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) compensation within the Washington D.C. metro area given a single snapshot of housing availability from Rentals.com. <br><br> <strong>Written &amp; Designed by</strong>: <em> Thomas P.

<div id="data-wrangling" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Wrangling</h1>
<p>Before any analysis was conducted, the original and unedited data that was scraped from Rentals.com was cleaned and reformated (better known as “tidied”). The first step of this process was removing extraneous features that consisted of many missing or unique values. Once that was complete, a preliminary review of each feature allowed for better understanding of the data and identify any remaining issues with the data’s structure. The final dataset, once cleaned, contained 23 features and 121 records.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of the 44 features in the dataset, just 30 percent contain any missing values. Of those 13 features, 8–<em>propertyType, propertyName, noVacancy, aggergates.totalAvailable, mPhone,</em> <em>neighborhoods,</em> and <em>revenue</em>–are missing more than 40 percent of their values. Consequently, these features will be dropped from the dataframe before proceeding with the analysis. While <em>lastUpdate</em> is also missing more than half of its values, some limited insights may be gained from studying this feature so it will not be removed at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the majority of still missing values originate from the <em>lastUpdate</em>, <em>recommendedListings,</em> and <em>nearbyListings</em> columns, these feature may lead to some interesting insights during time-series and network analyses so they cannot be removed. However, any record that is missing at least one value from the remaining columns will be removed. The next step in data wrangling is to identify columns (or features) that are unlikely to contribute insights during the analysis due to singularity (only one value present in the feature) or complete uniqueness (every record has its own value).</p>

<h3><em> Variable Uniqueness </em></h3>
<p><img src="project_files/figure-html/plot-uniqueness-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, this plot shows that the <em>isPaid</em> and <em>isCurrentSpotlight</em> features are non-unique; that is all values have the exact same value. Additionally, seven columns contain entirely unique values. While a few columns of unique identifiers may be useful–especially for some forms of network analysis–the current number is untenable. By looking at actual values, we know that little analytic value can be derived from the following columns: <em>propertyLabel</em>, <em>photos</em>, <em>listingSeoPath</em>, and <em>desktopPhone</em>. Collectively, these six features provide little insight and can be safely removed from the dataframe. Additional analysis reveals that the data represented in the features beginning with “listing” are duplicated in the similarly named “aggregates” feature. For example, every record in the <em>listingBathLow</em> column perfectly matches that of the <em>aggregates.baths.low</em> one. As a result, any column that begins with “aggregrates” will be dropped to eliminate this duplication of information. Similarly, <em>endecaID</em> and <em>listingID</em> contain duplicated information so only <em>listingID</em> will be retained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before any commentary can be made about the feature plot above, it is clear that the data still needs some cleaning as evidenced by the presence of a rental property in Vermont (state = ‘VT’) in the dataframe. While most likely a typo, this record will be dropped from the dataframe as a precaution since other features of this record may have been incorrectly entered as well. This analysis also shows a stark difference between the number of beds and baths available in the ‘high’ to the ‘low’ features. This is likely a feature of Rentals.com for apartment complexes where listing agents can post a single listing but for multiple apartments that range in size between 1-3 bedrooms and 1-2 bathrooms. To confirm that this is solely a feature of apartment listings, the next chart was generated.</p>

<h3><em> Feature Mismatch </em></h3>
<p><img src="project_files/figure-html/understand-mismatch-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since more than 99 percent of the cases where a listing has different values for the number of bedrooms or bathrooms available are for apartment listings, it is clearly a feature designed to make advertising apartments in large complexes easier. Unfortunately, this sort of data makes analysis very difficult and, as a result, any record that has this feature will be removed. This also allows for a cleaner dataframe where there is only one feature representing the the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.</p>

<p>With the exception of apartments, which have a clear tri-modal pricing strategy that is likely location-dependent (and will be investigated in the geospatial analysis), the average monthly rent increases by nearly $60 for every additional 100 square feet of interior space provided that other features remain constant. This is an unsurpising finding for those familiar with real estate, but a finding that bears further consideration during this analysis because as a service member becomes more senior (higher rank) they are expected to reside in larger housing. For example, a Captain in the United States Army (O-3) with dependents is anticipated to live in a 3-bedroom townhome while a Major (O-4) is expected to reside in a 3-bedroom single family residence. Given that the difference in BAH compensation between the two is $168 that would equate a difference in square footage of 280 square-feet (which is equates to the addition of a 20 feet x 14 feet room to the residence) which seems in line with the compesation difference.</p>

<p>Each additional bedroom increases the rental price by $194 (not including apartments), which is surprisingly low. This indicates that another factor (likely location) plays an important role in determining the overall value of a rental property.</p>

<p>In non-apartment rental units, the effect of an additional bathroom on the unit’s afforability is surprising! For comparable properties, each additional bathroom increases the average rental price by nearly $558, which is 65 percent more than the effect of each additional bedroom on the rental property’s list price.</p>

<h3>Geospatial Interpretations</h3>
<p>What is clear from this geospatial analysis is the general lack of rental properties available. While this data pull represents a single point in time, one would expect greater availability during the ‘peak move’ season. This is particularly true for 3-4 bedroom rentals, where only 10 properties were available for rent at this point in time. Furthermore, given that the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for individuals expecting to reside in 3-4 bedroom townhomes and single family homes is between $2,556 (E-6) and $3,171 (O-6) per month there is a clear lack of housing west of Washington D.C. in that price range, especially in close proximity of the Pentagon and other downtown assignments. Given that most residents of suburban communities in this area are dual-income, something that is often untenable for service member families due to the frequent moves, it seems that more should be done to ensure that service members are able to locate and afford appropriate housing near their Washington D.C. duty station.</p>

<p>With every rental property displayed on the network diagram above, it is clear that the majority of listings are located in or near downtown Washington D.C. What is even more clear is how interconnected those downtown listings are, as evidenced by the two listings with the greatest betweeness centrality being apartments located in Washington D.C.. Somewhat surprising, however, was that the node (rental listing) with the greatest degree centrality on the map had just four connections. Additionally, it is clear that additional factors are considered by Rentals.com for a listing to be displayed as a ‘Nearby Listing’ since many properties, particularly in the western suburbs, are not connected into the larger map despite having a close geographic proximity from other rental properties. This lack of connectivity can increase the challenges faced by service members and their families during their housing search as the number of available properties is limited (as discussed in the next section) and the nearby listings feature does not appear to generate many new leads for those looking to live in Washington D.C.’s western suburbs.</p>

<p>The issue of limited availability and recommended rental properities for Virginia suburbs is made even more clear once apartments (a realistic decision considering most service members and their families do not desire to live in an apartment) are removed from the network diagram. In fact, most rental properties in Virgnia are not tied into (or barely tied into) the larger rental property network. This is not the case for properties in Maryland (either northwest, northeast, or east of the city)! This is especially problematic as many military bases are located west of the city.</p>

<p>As to be expected the number of updates being made to rental listings begins to spike in middle-to-late June, following the end of the local school year. This aligns with the ‘peak move’ season, when the majority of people seek to complete their moves as to minimize the disruption to their childrens’ education. That said, the overall inventory appears exceptionally low for such a densely populated area. Curiously, no factor could be account for the two large spikes seen on 15 June and 26 June.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, 93 percent of updates to rental listings occured during weekdays with 77 percent of updates occuring on Mondays and Fridays. Even controlling for the large spikes–which occured on a Monday and Friday–those days of the weeks are still the most active for updating property listings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those familiar with the housing market in the Washington D.C. area, it is no surprise that most updates to listings for single family homes occur on Thursdays and Fridays. This is to ensure that the most current information is available to consumers prior to open houses over the weekend, where agents expect to receive multiple offers thereby taking the house off the market by Monday morning. This real estate tactic reveals how competitive the housing market in the region is, which disadvantages service members and their families during their search for new accomodations as they often have to compete remotely (still at their old duty station) or upon just showing up to the area and unfamiliar with the competitive market.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 percent of rental listings in the National Capital Region exist on Numbered or Lettered Streets (i.e. 14th Street NW or P St) and Avenues, which is a marked difference for many military personnel moving to the area. Most military members, especially those in the Army, are accustomed to quiet-suburban living and often struggle to adapt to living in a major metropolitian area.</p>
